# Diversity and Inclusion Primer
Some practical tips for inclusive writing, job descriptions and community organising. PR's and comments especially from folks with diverse perspectives welcome!

*In most cases it’s best to not make a big deal of someone’s identity, don’t reduce people to tokens*
- Promote people’s awesome work not their physical characteristics or identity.
- Don’t publicly single out ‘diverse’ people solely because of their identity.
- Amplify people’s own voices, don’t speak for them.

If you *must* mention people’s identity, or you are writing / speaking specifically about diversity and inclusivity…
- Check your wording for colloquialisms that might be condescending or offensive.
- If in doubt just use the proper, or most respectful terms.
- Google proper terms if you’re not 100% sure.
- Remember inclusive means welcoming to everyone, not just white, cis, able men and women.
- Read your ad/slides/invite etc text with terms for a different group substituted - if it suddenly sounds weird rewrite!
- “Guys/he/him/man” are not gender neutral.

Some general culture stuff…
- Assume people you meet at work / industry events are technically proficient, even if you think they look young, or more like a designer, or whatever.
- If you mess up and offend someone that has less privilege than you, don’t expect them to make you feel better about it.
- Educate yourself about diversity and inclusion, share what you have learned with other privileged people rather than expecting marginalised people to do that work.
- Don’t equate traditionally masculine traits with higher intelligence or work quality.
- Don’t value masculine traits more than feminine traits.
- Don’t assign higher value to white dress / hair styles or predominantly white experiences.
- If you need ongoing advice please consider hiring a diversity consultant.
